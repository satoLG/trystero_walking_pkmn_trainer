A multiplayer experiment using trystero (https://github.com/dmotz/trystero).

Basically, you choose a trainer, a pkmn, walk around with it, see their diferent sizes and cries.

Everyone will join a single room using trystero, meaning anyone opening this website will appear to others and vice versa.
